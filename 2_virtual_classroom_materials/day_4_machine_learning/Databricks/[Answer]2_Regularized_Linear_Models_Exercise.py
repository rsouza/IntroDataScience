# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Instantiate alinear regression under the variable `lr`.
# MAGIC - Fit `lr` to `x_train_poly`, `y_train `.
# MAGIC - Predict with `lr` on `x_train_poly` and store the results to `y_hat_train`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The RMSE is almost twice as big for the test set than for the train set. This suggests overfitting and a poor generalization power of the model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We use the function `plot_coef` on the coefficients of the fitted model to see the values of the coefficients and the average value of the coefficients.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

plot_coef(lr.coef_)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The coefficients in combination with the error values on train and test suggest that we deal here with overfitting of the model on the given set of polynomial features. We should therefore use **regularization**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Standardization
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before fitting any regularized model, the scaling of the features is crucial. Otherwise the regularization would not be fair to features of different scales. Regularized linear models assume that the inputs to the model have a zero mean and a variance in the same magnitude. `StandarScaler()` deducts the mean and divides by the standard deviation. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Instantiate `StandardScaler()` under the name `scaler`.
# MAGIC - Apply the `fit_transform` method with the input `x_train_poly` to `scaler` and store the result into `x_train_scaled`.
# MAGIC - Once the scaler is fit to `x_train_poly` you can directly transform `x_test_poly` and store it in the variable `X_test_scaled`. You never want to fit on a test sample, because that way information from the test data might leak. Test data serves only for evaluation.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC # Elastic Net

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Elastic Net is a combination of Lasso and Ridge which is defined by a parameter `l1_ratio`. If it is equal to 1 the model is equivalent to Lasso, if it is 0 then it is as if we had a Ridge regression. The regularization strength alpha can be defined just as in Ridge or Lasso. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can enforce the values of the parameters to be positive with the parameter `positive = True`. Such an option is also available for Lasso. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For all the variations of the linear regression you can enforce it to fit the model without an intercept. This can be done by setting the parameter `fit_intercept=False`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There is an option to scale data by the norm of each feature. If normalization is applied to fitting of the model it is automatically also applied to the `predict()`. We can use this method instead of standard scaling done at the beginning. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Experiment with the parameters of `ElasticNet()`. Fit the model to `x_train_lasso` and `y_train` with different set of options, e.g.
# MAGIC - `positive=True`
# MAGIC - `fit_intercept=False`
# MAGIC - `l1_ratio = 0`, `0.5`, `1`
# MAGIC - `alpha = 0.001`, `0.01`, `0.1`, `1`, `10`, `100`
# MAGIC - `normalize=True`    
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Plot the coefficients with `plot_coef` to see the effect on the coefficients.
# MAGIC Return the RMSE on train and test set.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 10
