# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's have a look at some metrics. Compute and save the following metrics on the test set:

# MAGIC - MSE -  `mean_squared_error` from `sklearn.metrics` (see ?mean_squared_error)
# MAGIC - RMSE - `mean_squared_error`  from `sklearn.metrics` with the parameter `squared` set to `False`
# MAGIC - MAE (Mean absolute error) - `mean_absolute_error`  from `sklearn.metrics` (see ?mean_absolute_error)
# MAGIC - R2 (score) - this is an attribute of `LinearRegression()`

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 11: Compute and save the metrics on the test set

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_hat)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_hat, squared=False)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_hat)

print(f"R2: {np.round(r2, 1)}") 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Scaling
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC If features are not scaled appropriately, the intercept tells you what the expected value for the target variable would be if all the variables were equal to 0. This might be unrealistic for many features such as weight, size of the house, distance to the sea, etc. 
# MAGIC When features are scaled correctly, the intercept can be interpreted as the expected value of a target variable when all the features are equal to their averages.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For the next exercise you will scale your features using `StandardScaler()`.
# MAGIC - Instantiate `StandardScaler()` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
# MAGIC - Fit the scaler to `X_train` and transform it. Save the transformed values into `X_train_scaled`.
# MAGIC - Transform the `X_test` data with the fitted scaler and save the transformed values into `X_test_scaled`.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 12: Scaling

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC If you scaled properly you will see in the boxplot chart on the right that the distribution of the variables are concentrated around zero and that the variance is similar for all the variables.

# COMMAND ----------

plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.title('Boxplots for original features')
sns.boxplot(data=X_train)
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.title('Boxplots for scaled features')
sns.boxplot(data=X_train_scaled);

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Fit a linear regression model to `X_train_scaled`, `y_train`.
# MAGIC - Return the value for the intercept.
# MAGIC - Return the values for the coefficients and save them to the variable `model_coef`.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 13: Fit a linear regression, return values and save them to the variable model_coef

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
print(f"intercept: {model.intercept_}")
model_coef = model.coef_

# COMMAND ----------

df_coefs = pd.DataFrame(model.coef_.T, index = X_train.columns, columns=["Coefficient"]) \
            .sort_values("Coefficient") \
            .T
display(df_coefs)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC After applying `StandardScaler()` it is easier to compare coefficients with each other as the features all have the same scale. In our example the positive effect of the 'RM' variable on the output is a little bit smaller than the negative effect of the 'LSTAT' variable. In that vein, we can order the coefficients by their absolute magnitudes to understand the influence of the variables on the result. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We could then try to fit the model with the variables that have the highest coefficient values in absolute terms.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Exercise 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Predict with the fitted model on `X_test_scaled`.
# MAGIC - Calculate MSE, RMSE, MASE and R2. Did it change compared to the unscaled version of linear regression?

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 14

y_hat = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
print(f"MSE: {np.round(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_hat),1)}")
print(f"RMSE: {np.round(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_hat, squared=False),1)}")
print(f"MAE: {np.round(mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_hat),1)}")
print(f"R2: {np.round(model.score(X_test_scaled, y_test),1)}") # the same as r2_score(y_test, y_hat)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The scaling **does not have an effect on the performance of the model**. It only helps with interpretability of the coefficients and changes the meaning of the intercept. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Result Analysis
# MAGIC Now that we have fitted a model on the standardized features and calculated the different scores, we need to analyse these results.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Residuals
# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC - Calculate residuals by deducting `y_test` from `y_hat`.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 15: Calculate residuals by deducting y_test from y_hat

residuals = y_hat - y_test

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC One of the assumptions of a linear regression is that the **residuals are normally distributed**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC From the histogram below it seems that the residuals are almost normally distributed. If this is actually the case can be tested with e.g. the Kolmogorov-Smironov test or the Shapiro-Wilk test. It is also possible to draw a quantile-quantile plot. We could investigate outliers to check if they impact the residuals. 

# COMMAND ----------

plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.scatter(y_test, residuals)
plt.ylabel("residuals")
plt.xlabel("y_test")
plt.title("Residuals against true values")

plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.hist(residuals)
plt.xlabel("residuals")
plt.ylabel("frequency")
plt.title("Residuals histogram")
plt.show();

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Exercise – The Dependent Variable
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The lower long tail on the histogram might be also due to the distribution of the dependent variable y. When doing exploratory data analysis we should look only at the train set so that we do not detect patterns from the test set. The test set is set aside and is used only for evaluation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Create a boxplot of `y_train`.
# MAGIC - Plot a histogram of `y_train`.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 16 - create a boxplot
plt.title('y_train boxplot')
plt.boxplot(y_train);

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC It seems that there are some outliers on the upper part. This is expected as there can be some very expensive houses.  

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 17 - create a histogram
plt.title('y_train histogram')
plt.hist(y_train);

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The distribution of the target variable seems to be rather bimodal. Linear regression does not perform the best for such distributions. However, if we did not take into consideration the outliers, the distribution would be closer to a normal distribution. However, are they really outliers? 
# MAGIC So the question is if we should **transform the dependent variable**. We could also consider creating two separate linear models, one for the usual values and one for the values on the upper end. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Exercise – Outliers
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Might the skewness of the residuals be due to the outliers in the explanatory features?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Draw a boxplot for `X_train`. You can use for example a boxplot from the seaborn library.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 18

sns.boxplot(data=X_train);

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC There seem to be quite some outliers, e.g. in CRIM, ZN and PTRATIO B. These outliers should be treated.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Exercise – Multicollinearity
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Correlated features might cause the model to be quite unstable. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Calculate the correlations between all the variables with the `corr()` method called on `X_train`. Save the output into variable `corr`.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 19

corr = X_train.corr()
corr

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Below you can see correlations of the variables between each other on the left chart. Right chart shows absolute values of correlations. 

# COMMAND ----------

# charts for correlation
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.title('Correlations')
mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=bool))
sns.heatmap(corr, mask = mask, annot=True, cmap='Reds');

plt.title('Absolute value of correlations')
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
corr_abs = corr.abs()
sns.heatmap(corr_abs, mask = mask, annot=True, cmap='Reds');

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC There is a strong correlation between some features, e.g. TAX and RAD, DIS and NOX, DIS and INUDS, DIS and AGE, LSTAT and RM. **Highly correlated features in linear models can cause instability of the model**. Thus it should be tested how the models perform if we remove such features. Usually one of the features with a correlation higher than some threshold is removed from the feature set. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Linearity – Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Since we work with a linear model, there should be a linear relationship between X and y. Let's do some simple checks. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Compute the correlation between `X_train` and `y_train`. Hint: you can concatenate `X_train` and `y_train` first on `axis=1` and calculate the correlation on the concatenated data frame.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 20

data_train = pd.concat([X_train,y_train], axis=1)
data_train.corr()['target'].sort_values(ascending=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There is a strong negative correlation between the target variable and the 'LSTAT' feature, as well as a strong positive correlation between the target variable and the 'RM' feature. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Draw a scatter plot showing the dependency between X and y not only for the two most correlated features 'LSTAT' and 'RM' but also for the other features to investigate if there is any pattern.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 21

data_train = pd.concat([X_train,y_train], axis=1)
corr_target = data_train.corr()['target'].abs().sort_values(ascending=False)

sns.pairplot(data_train, y_vars = 'target', x_vars=corr_target.index[1:5], height = 10);
sns.pairplot(data_train, y_vars = 'target', x_vars=corr_target.index[5:10], height = 10);
sns.pairplot(data_train, y_vars = 'target', x_vars=corr_target.index[10:14], height = 10);

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC We already know that there is a strong correlation between the target and the variable 'LSTAT' but the relationship seems to be rather non-linear. We can transform the variable 'LSTAT' for example with a negative logarithm or x-squared function to get a linear relationship between the modified variable and y. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The relationship with the second highest correlated feature 'RM' seems to be linear.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Model only with the 2 strongest variables 
# MAGIC ### Exercise
# MAGIC - Fit the model only with the features 'LSTAT' and 'RM'.
# MAGIC - Predict and return the RMSE.

# COMMAND ----------

# Task 22

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train[['LSTAT', 'RM']], y_train)
y_hat = model.predict(X_test[['LSTAT', 'RM']])
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_hat, squared=False)
print(f"RMSE: {np.round(rmse,1)}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC This model has a slightly worse performance than the original model with an RMSE of around 4.7. However, interpretaion of the model with 2 variables is easier and usually the generalization of the simpler model is also better. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## 2nd degree polynomial features
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We have seen in the scatter plots that there likely is a non-linear relationship between 'LSTAT' and the target variable. It makes sense to test the model with the 2 variables as above but also adding polynomial features of the 2nd degree and an interaction term between the two variables. Run the cell below to see the performance of such a model.

# COMMAND ----------

y_hat = model_poly.predict(x_test_poly)
print(f"RMSE: {mean_squared_error(y_test, y_hat, squared=False)}")
# depending on the version of sklearn, this will cause an error
# in that case, replace "get_feature_names_out" with "get_feature_names"
pd.DataFrame(model_poly.coef_, index = ["Coefficient"], columns = poly.get_feature_names_out())

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC This model has so far the best performance.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Next steps to consider
# MAGIC How can we improve our current model even further?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Treatment of the y variable - Should we use two different models? Should we transform y?
# MAGIC - Outliers need to be treated.
# MAGIC - Feature selection methods.
# MAGIC - Removal of correlated features.
