# MAGIC In the previous notebook we constructed our first pipeline:
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC entire_pipeline = Pipeline([('feature_engineering', feature_engineering), ('dummy', DummyClassifier(strategy="most_frequent"))])
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC Hold your constructed pipeline firmly! The only thing that we need to do now is to replace `DummyClassifier` with a proper learning model.   
# MAGIC We can start with a decision tree.

# Store the result as dt_pipeline.

# Store the result as y_pred_TRAIN_DT.
# Also, display accuracy.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Looking at the accuracy on training and holdout set, what can you infer about over model? Will it generalize well?

# COMMAND ----------

# OPTIONAL TASK 2: Do the same steps with RandomForest with default parameters. 
# Does the RandomForest display similar results as decision tree? If not, why?

# Reuse your composite and fit a random forest with default parameters.
# Store the result as rf_pipeline.

# MAGIC ### Tuning Hyperparameters of our Decision Tree
# MAGIC Time to improve the performance of our learning model by finding its optimal set of hyperparameters.  
# MAGIC We start by examining **which hyperparameters are available** in our decision tree pipeline.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC We would like to tune `max_depth` and `min_samples_split`.  
# MAGIC Notice that to access them, we also need to navigate within the composite and call them as **`decision_tree`**`__max_depth`.  

# COMMAND ----------

# TASK 3: Define a grid through which we should search. 
# Tune parameters: max_depth and min_samples_split.
# The values which you pick as parameters are up to you. You can think about them intuitively.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Optional Advanced TASK: Tuning Random Forest
# MAGIC When you are tuning a more complex model, it is good practice to search available literature on which hyperparameters should be tuned. Below I have predefined some. You can play around with the grid, for example expand or narrow it. Keep in mind that as our feature set is extremely limited, its hard for hyperparameter tuning to arrive at something meaningful.
