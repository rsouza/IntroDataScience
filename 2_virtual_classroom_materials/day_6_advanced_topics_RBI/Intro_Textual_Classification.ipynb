    "In this tutorial competition, we dig a little \"deeper\" into sentiment analysis. Google's Word2Vec is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words. It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but is computationally more efficient. This tutorial focuses on Word2Vec for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a challenging subject in machine learning. People express their emotions in language that is often obscured by sarcasm, ambiguity, and plays on words, all of which could be very misleading for both humans and computers. There's another Kaggle competition for movie review sentiment analysis. In this tutorial we explore how Word2Vec can be applied to a similar problem.\n",

    "Deep learning has been in the news a lot over the past few years, even making it to the front page of the New York Times. These machine learning techniques, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and made possible by recent advances in computing power, have been making waves via breakthrough results in image recognition, speech processing, and natural language tasks. Recently, deep learning approaches won several Kaggle competitions, including a drug discovery task, and cat and dog image recognition."

    "Now that we have our training reviews tidied up, how do we convert them to some kind of numeric representation for machine learning? One common approach is called a Bag of Words. The Bag of Words model learns a vocabulary from all of the documents, then models each document by counting the number of times each word appears. For example, consider the following two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: \"The cat sat on the hat\"  \n",
    "Sentence 2: \"The dog ate the cat and the hat\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "From these two sentences, our vocabulary is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "\n",
    "To get our bags of words, we count the number of times each word occurs in each sentence. In Sentence 1, \"the\" appears twice, and \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", and \"hat\" each appear once, so the feature vector for Sentence 1 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: [ 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the features for Sentence 2 are: [ 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the IMDB data, we have a very large number of reviews, which will give us a large vocabulary. To limit the size of the feature vectors, we should choose some maximum vocabulary size. Below, we use the 5000 most frequent words (remembering that stop words have already been removed).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the feature_extraction module from scikit-learn to create bag-of-words features.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Introducing Distributed Word Vectors: This part of the tutorial will focus on using distributed word vectors created by the Word2Vec algorithm, using the Gensim implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html  \n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec, published by Google in 2013, is a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words. Other deep or recurrent neural network architectures had been proposed for learning word representations prior to this, but the major problem with these was the long time required to train the models. Word2vec learns quickly relative to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec does not need labels in order to create meaningful representations. This is useful, since most data in the real world is unlabeled. If the network is given enough training data (tens of billions of words), it produces word vectors with intriguing characteristics. Words with similar meanings appear in clusters, and clusters are spaced such that some word relationships, such as analogies, can be reproduced using vector math. The famous example is that, with highly trained word vectors, \"king - man + woman = queen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed word vectors are powerful and can be used for many applications, particularly word prediction and translation. Here, we will try to apply them to sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using word2vec in Python: In Python, we will use the excellent implementation of word2vec from the gensim package. If you don't already have gensim installed, you'll need to install it. There is an excellent tutorial that accompanies the Python Word2Vec implementation, here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Word2Vec does not require graphics processing units (GPUs) like many deep learning algorithms, it is compute intensive. Both Google's version and the Python version rely on multi-threading (running multiple processes in parallel on your computer to save time). ln order to train your model in a reasonable amount of time, you will need to install cython (instructions here). Word2Vec will run without cython installed, but it will take days to run instead of minutes. "

    "We are going to use the whole set of sentences for training, the labeled and the unlabeled, which contains 50,000 additional reviews with no labels. When we built the Bag of Words model in Part 1, extra unlabeled training reviews were not useful. However, since Word2Vec can learn from unlabeled data, these extra 50,000 reviews can now be used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To train Word2Vec it is better not to remove stop words because the algorithm relies on the broader context of the sentence in order to produce high-quality word vectors."

For details on the algorithms below, see the word2vec API documentation as well as the Google documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture: Architecture options are skip-gram (default) or continuous bag of words. We found that skip-gram was very slightly slower but produced better results.\n",

    "\n",
    "Downsampling of frequent words: The Google documentation recommends values between .00001 and .001. For us, values closer 0.001 seemed to improve the accuracy of the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vector dimensionality: More features result in longer runtimes, and often, but not always, result in better models. Reasonable values can be in the tens to hundreds; we used 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context / window size: How many words of context should the training algorithm take into account? 10 seems to work well for hierarchical softmax (more is better, up to a point).\n",
    "\n",
    "Worker threads: Number of parallel processes to run. This is computer-specific, but between 4 and 6 should work on most systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum word count: This helps limit the size of the vocabulary to meaningful words. Any word that does not occur at least this many times across all documents is ignored. Reasonable values could be between 10 and 100. In this case, since each movie occurs 30 times, we set the minimum word count to 40, to avoid attaching too much importance to individual movie titles. This resulted in an overall vocabulary size of around 15,000 words. Higher values also help limit run time.\n",

    "Since the element-wise average of the vectors didn't produce spectacular results, perhaps we could do it in a more intelligent way? A standard way of weighting word vectors is to apply \"tf-idf\" weights, which measure how important a given word is within a given set of documents. One way to extract tf-idf weights in Python is by using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, which has an interface similar to the CountVectorizer that we used in Part 1. However, when we tried weighting our word vectors in this way, we found no substantial improvement in performance.\n",

    "## From Words to Paragraphs, Attempt 2: Clustering\n",
    "Word2Vec creates clusters of semantically related words, so another possible approach is to exploit the similarity of words within a cluster. Grouping vectors in this way is known as \"vector quantization.\" To accomplish this, we first need to find the centers of the word clusters, which we can do by using a clustering algorithm such as K-Means.\n",
    "\n",
    "In K-Means, the one parameter we need to set is \"K,\" or the number of clusters. How should we decide how many clusters to create? Trial and error suggested that small clusters, with an average of only 5 words or so per cluster, gave better results than large clusters with many words. Clustering code is given below. We use scikit-learn to perform our K-Means.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means clustering with large K can be very slow; the following code took more than 40 minutes on my computer. Below, we set a timer around the K-Means function to see how long it takes."

    "We found that the code above gives about the same (or slightly worse) results compared to the Bag of Words in Part 1.\n",

    "You may ask: Why is Bag of Words better?\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest reason is, in our tutorial, averaging the vectors and using the centroids lose the order of words, making it very similar to the concept of Bag of Words. The fact that the performance is similar (within range of standard error) makes all three methods practically equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, training Word2Vec on a lot more text should greatly improve performance. Google's results are based on word vectors that were learned out of more than a billion-word corpus; our labeled and unlabeled training sets together are only a measly 18 million words or so. Conveniently, Word2Vec provides functions to load any pre-trained model that is output by Google's original C tool, so it's also possible to train a model in C and then import it into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in published literature, distributed word vector techniques have been shown to outperform Bag of Words models. In this paper, an algorithm called Paragraph Vector is used on the IMDB dataset to produce some of the most state-of-the-art results to date. In part, it does better than the approaches we try here because vector averaging and clustering lose the word order, whereas Paragraph Vectors preserves word order information.\n",

    "What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"deep learning\" was coined in 2006, and refers to machine learning algorithms that have multiple non-linear layers and can learn feature hierarchies [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern machine learning relies on feature engineering or some level of domain knowledge to obtain good results. In deep learning systems, this is not the case -- instead, algorithms can automatically learn feature hierarchies, which represent objects in increasing levels of abstraction. Although the basic ingredients of many deep learning algorithms have been around for many years, they are currently increasing in popularity for many reasons, including advances in compute power, the falling cost of computing hardware, and advances in machine learning research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning algorithms can be categorized by their architecture (feed-forward, feed-back, or bi-directional) and training protocols (purely supervised, hybrid, or unsupervised) [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Some good background materials include:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] \"Deep Learning for Signal and Information Processing\", by Li Deng and Dong Yu (out of Microsoft)\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] \"Deep Learning Tutorial\" (2013 Presentation by Yann LeCun and Marc'Aurelio Ranzato)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where Does Word2Vec Fit In?\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec works in a way that is similar to deep approaches such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but it implements certain algorithms, such as hierarchical softmax, that make it computationally more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Part 2 of this tutorial for more on Word2Vec, as well as this paper: Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use a hybrid approach to training -- consisting of an unsupervised piece (Word2Vec) followed by supervised learning (the Random Forest)."
